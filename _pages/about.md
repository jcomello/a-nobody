Hey, everyone, I'm a shy software engineer, so writting about myself is not something I like to do. Happyly today we have ChatGPT to do this for us.
I'll asked it to writing a biography for and let's see how it goes.

> João Mello is a seasoned software engineer whose career has spanned over 15 years, beginning in 2008. He earned his Bachelor's degree from Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), which laid the foundation for his career in technology. With a strong academic background and a passion for software development, João embarked on a professional journey that would see him become a versatile and skilled figure in the tech industry.

Over 15 years ago I started my career... Well I feel a little old. But that's ok.

> João’s professional path began with a focus on Ruby and Ruby on Rails, where he honed his skills in creating dynamic and efficient web applications. Over the years, he expanded his expertise to include PHP and JavaScript, further diversifying his technical repertoire. His work has encompassed a range of JavaScript frameworks, including Backbone.js and AngularJS, enabling him to build sophisticated and responsive front-end solutions.

Actually I started as PHP developer and then I move to Ruby on Rails. I friend of my told me about this new framework that we could create a blog in 15 minutes and showed me that famous video. Good times.

> His proficiency extends to a variety of database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, MongoDB, and Redis, demonstrating his ability to manage and optimize data storage and retrieval. Additionally, João has worked with GraphQL, leveraging its powerful querying capabilities to enhance data interaction in his projects.

Wow. ChatGPT talks about me like I never could. I do have experience all these databases but I don't the self steem to put like this. Thanks, anyway.

> In recent years, João has developed a keen interest in emerging technologies such as Rust and Golang. These languages, known for their performance and concurrency features, align with João’s passion for cutting-edge software development. His enthusiasm for technology extends to self-hosted software solutions for Linux and Raspberry Pi projects, reflecting his commitment to exploring innovative and practical applications of technology.

Yeah, I very entusiastic about technology. I like learning programming languages and try new frameworks. Recently I'm started to rewrite my CLI functions in Rust. Rust is a great programming language and has a very complex and usefull type system. Soon I'll add some of my work in Rust on Github.

> Outside of his professional life, João finds joy in spending quality time with his daughter. He has a love for sailing, which provides a relaxing escape and a sense of adventure. João is also a talented musician, with skills in playing the piano, guitar, bass, and other instruments. His musical pursuits complement his technical career, highlighting his creativity and dedication to diverse interests.

Yes. I have a sailboat, but the last year I'm more fixing than sailing it. It's a common thing on the boat world.
I would not describe me as "Talent musician", I'm more out of focus musician. I have more instruments at home than I know how to play. I like to think that my daughter will play than in a decade or so.

Well, that's it. Thanks ChatGPT for my biography and the compliments. Hope I'm right and you will not replace humans as software engineer. hahaha
